# Django rationale

a taste of django

# When to use django

- easy to get off the ground
- want out-of-the-box functionality
  - defaults for email, error reporting, caching, database...
- Relational database
- python

Not relational? use Flask, Sinatra, or Express

Django: 2005

Similar projects from other languages: Rails (2005), phoenix, laravel

# What we'll be building

RetroSocial, a basic social network

- signup / login / logout
- posting
- messaging

Hint: if you want a more fleshed-out, open-source social network in django (yes, they exist), see
